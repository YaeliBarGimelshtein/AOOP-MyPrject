Advanced Object-oriented programming FINAL PROJECT.
By: Yaeli Bar Gimelshtein.

Undo:
	My system allows to undo more than once, with use of stack.
Delete:
	Allows to search and delete a product and also delete all.
	
Read from file:
		If there is a file, even only with saving method for map, the system will read it and the program will start there.
		If you undo to a file that was read- it will go back to as to how the file looked when was first read.
